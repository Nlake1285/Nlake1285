- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zlake!
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, but on here I want to publish code/get better at coding + navigating and using GitHub
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at the University of Montana
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any upcoming coding projects (If the assistance is allowed, that is)
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at zenith.lake@umconnect.umt.edu or Zlake1285@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: any/all. You can call me anything except late for dinner!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite color is this blue: #89cff0
